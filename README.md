# Simple 2D Particle Explosion with Collision in p5.js

## Description:
This repository contains a simple p5.js sketch that demonstrates a 2D particle explosion with collision detection and response. When the user clicks on the canvas, multiple particles are generated at the mouse position, simulating an explosion. Each particle reacts to gravity and collisions with both the canvas edges and other particles.

## Features:

2D particle explosion effect with user interaction (mouse clicks)
Gravity affecting the particles
Circle-to-circle collision detection and response for particles
Basic elastic collision handling
Simple p5.js sketch structure with setup, draw, and mousePressed functions

## Dependencies:

p5.js library (https://p5js.org/)

##Further development ideas:

Add friction to the particles to simulate air resistance or surface contact.
Implement different collision behaviors, such as inelastic collisions or particle merging.
Optimize the code for better performance with large numbers of particles.
Add more user interaction options, such as adjusting gravity or particle properties.
Enhance the visual appearance of the particles, using colors, shapes, or textures.
